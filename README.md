## 👨‍💻️ Introduction

I was looking for examples of React Forms and validation when I came across this great article. I decided to use it as a guide and reference.

### 👏️ Special thanks to: ✨️[Gift Uhiene](https://github.com/Giftea), the article was written by her.

This is the GitHub repository for the
[How to Validate Forms with Zod and React-Hook-Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-form-validation-zod-react-hook-form)
tutorial. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a type-safe form using [React-Hook-Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) for form management and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for both client-side and server-side validation.

1. Clone the `main` branch of this repository:

```

2. Run the command below to install dependencies:

```bash

3. Start the development server:
